Welcome to the Eperio code repository.

The verification script is located at: 
~/python_openssl/verify.py

To use the script, copy it into a directory of Eperio election data. This is the directory that contains subdirectories for each instance (01, 02, ..), AssertedTally.csv, AssertedReceipts.csv, etc. A sample has been provided at:
~/sample_data/test_election_1/

The script requires Python and OpenSSL. It should work 'out-of-the-box' with Ubuntu or OS X. Invoke it using: 

python verify.py
